NestJS Boilerplate is an open-source high-level framework for [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) applications.
It takes it up a notch by making it possible to solve repeatable tasks with less coding. It provides an architectural 
model based on Domain Driven Design and contains a variety of extra tools for a quick start developing NestJS
applications. The NestJS Boilerplate aims to follow the principle of pluggable modules to extend functionality and
less repeating common code from project to project. Inspired by Spring Framework, AspNet Boilerplate and Django.
